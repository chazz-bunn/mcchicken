                <p>
                    For me, it's the McChicken. The <strong>best</strong> fast food sandwich. I even ask for extra McChicken sauce packets and the staff is so friendly and more than willing to oblige.

                    One time I asked for McChicken sauce packets and they gave me three. I said, <em>"Wow, three for free!"</em> and the nice friendly McDonald's worker laughed and said, <em>"I'm going to call you 3-for-free!".</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now the staff greets me with <em>"hey it's 3-for-free!"</em> and <strong>ALWAYS</strong> give me three packets. It's such a fun and cool atmosphere at my local McDonald's restaurant, I go there at least 3 times a week for lunch and a large iced coffee with milk instead of cream, 1-2 times for breakfast on the weekend, and maybe once for dinner when I'm in a rush but want a great meal that is affordable, fast, and can match my daily nutritional needs.

                    I even dip my fries in McChicken sauce, it's delicious! What a great restaurant.
